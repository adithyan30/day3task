for the given json iterate over all for loops (for, for in, for of, foreach):-

   * There may be times where you feel you need to make a loop through the array of JSON objects in JavaScript. However, you no longer need to worry about this, 
as it can be done using an array of numbers, strings,or objects.There are numerous ways of looping in JavaScript and throughout this article we’ll help you grasp them.
   * There are a few types of ways to categorize the loops in JavaScript. These are essential to know as they play a significant role in understanding the concept.
   
 The For Loop:-
    * The For Loop comes first because of its simplicity and ease of use. It is a very user-friendly kind of loop that runs with a method of using a counter. 
    * The value is first set with an appropriate condition, which is also called ‘initializing a loop’. Next, the terminal or final value is specified. 
      The For Loop makes things really easy when you need to run a set of codes multiple times.
    1. Using an array
          The following piece of code is a perfect example of how to use a for loop through an array.  
          
        
            var numbers = [ 10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
            for (var i=0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
               console.log(numbers[i])
            }
          
    Here,I have used all the numbers in the form of an array,then printed each of them in a console window.In the same way,you can make a loop through an array of strings.
    
    2. Making a loop through DOM elements
      * The For loop can also be used to alter colors.Consider a situation where you want to choose a particular color for all the anchors of your page.
        In order to do so,use the following piece of 
            
            
            var elements = document.querySelectorAll("a");
              for (var i=0; i<elements.length; i++) {
                 elements[i].style.color = "red";
              }
              ‍
    When you look at the above code, things might not seem very clear. 

   * I first used document.querySelectorAll("a")to get all of my anchors in the array format.Once that was done, the next step looped all the array and changed its color.
   * Here, we used the color red, but you may choose any color in the code and the anchors of your page will appear that particular color. 
   
   The For In Loop:-
      * Another way of looping is the For In Loop. Unlike the For Loop, this loop won’t be using a counter. So this makes the whole process even more simple and hassle-free. 
       In fact, the For In Loop is essentially a simplified version of the For Loop.

        The following are different ways of looping using the For In technique.
        
        1. Looping through an Object Property:-
        Here’s an example;
              you’ve got an object containing some properties and you need to look up each property and the value that it carries.    
                  Here’s how you would use the For In Loop to do so:
                    
                    var person = {
                       fname: "Nick",
                       lname: "Jonas",
                       age: 26
                    }; 
                    for (let x in person) {
                         console.log(x + ": "+ person[x])
                      }
                    
    3. The ForEach() Loop:-
      This method is used for looping through an array element. Here’s an example of this:

                      
                      var names = ["jerry", "tom", "pluto", "micky", "mini"];
                      names.forEach(function1);
                      function function1(currentValue, index) {
                         console.log("Index in array is: "+index + " ::  Value is: "+currentValue);
                      }
